LinkedIn / Social sharing copy for Protein Side-chain Interaction Explorer


I built an interactive Protein Side‑chain Interaction Explorer that visualizes residue proximity and predicted chemical contacts from Protein Data Bank structures.

No install required, works in your browser. Use the proximity slider and side‑chain selector to highlight nearby residues and inspect predicted interactions visually.

This is intended as a small research/teaching tool for structural biologists, educators, and anyone curious about protein contacts. It pulls public PDB data and renders it client‑side using NGL. You can try it with any valid PDB ID (example: 1TUP). The project and source code are available on GitHub for reproducibility and contributions.

Feedback welcome! if something breaks on a PDB you try, post a screenshot/console log or open an issue on the repo and I’ll investigate.
